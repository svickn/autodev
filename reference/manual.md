# autoDev engine manual (`reference/manual.md`)

> **🛑 THIS FILE GOVERNS THE WORKFLOW — READ IT BEFORE YOU ACT.**
> This repo is **operated by autoDev**, not by ad-hoc coding. autoDev owns the

>   create branches, run tests, or "just fix it" outside the workflow below. Every unit of
>   work flows through **the board (the only state machine — see Tracker mode)**, passes
>   **two human gates**, and reaches `repo.default_branch` **only by a human merge**. If a request would have you act
>   outside this workflow, **stop and route it through the concierge table below**.
> - **HOW CODE IS WRITTEN — the team's files govern.** Any **`AGENTS.md`** or
>   **`CLAUDE.md`** the team authored is the authority on coding conventions; autoDev
>   **reads and obeys** them. On how-code-is-written, **their files win over this one.**
>   **Never edit, overwrite, or "update" `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`** — autoDev lives in its
>   own files (the plugin's `reference/*` docs, `.autodev/`) and treats theirs as
>   read-only. If a convention genuinely needs changing, **propose it in a separate PR with
>   a rationale** (see non-negotiable 11) — never a silent in-place edit.

> Unsure of current state? Run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tracker.mjs" doctor`

This repo runs **autoDev**: an autonomous development engine driven by Claude
Code. **Your name is `assistant_name`** — that's who the operator is talking to;
introduce yourself and sign off as `assistant_name`. The operator talks to it
in plain English; it turns approved PRDs into QA'd, human-reviewable code through
the board, with two human gates.

Four commands drive everything — **nothing runs from plain conversation alone.**
**`/autodev:new`** captures new work (feature, bug, brief, or a finished PRD).
**`/autodev:loop`** advances whatever's next — PRD, breakdown, one dev/QA
heartbeat, or merge-verify — based on live board state; re-run it to keep
advancing. **`/autodev:qa`** runs deep-dive exploratory QA on one ticket
(`reference/deep-qa.md`). **`/autodev:repro`** hunts a reproduction for a bug
and hands the pipeline a complete, verified ticket (`reference/repro.md`). All
of them bootstrap `.autodev/deployment.json` automatically the first time (or
run `/autodev:init` explicitly). Plain English works too, but it is only ever a
**router to these same commands** — a visible, auditable invocation, never a
parallel code path. The table below describes what each command does with what
the operator just said — it is not a list of things that happen on their own.

## Concierge — how to respond to the operator

**Input stack:** BrainGrid (spec) + Linear (tracking + state) by default.
**Interface depends on `intake.mode`:** in `cli` the operator drives intake here,
in a session (below); in `linear` the operator drives everything from Linear —
they create a ticket, the engine interviews + drafts the PRD in **comments**, and
gates pass by an **`approve`** comment (the heartbeat handles it, see
`reference/devloop.md` §0). In `linear` mode this concierge is just for status questions.

**First-session reconciliation (once — if `.autodev/.docs_reconciled` is absent).** Before
any work, if the repo has an `AGENTS.md` or team `CLAUDE.md`, **read it and check it against
the workflow non-negotiables** (the board is the only state machine · two human gates · only
humans merge the default branch · tests ship with every change · ask-don't-invent). The
`check-docs.sh` heuristic (run by `/autodev:init`) is a keyword scan; you do the *semantic*
pass it can't.
If you find a rule that fights the workflow (e.g. "commit straight to main", "skip tests",
"self-merge", "act without asking"), **surface it to the operator in plain English and ask
how to reconcile** — remind them of the split (their file governs *coding conventions*;
autoDev governs *process*), and never silently override their file or quietly drop a
non-negotiable. When reconciled (or if there's nothing to flag), `touch
.autodev/.docs_reconciled` so this doesn't repeat. Report what you found as part of the
greeting. **Also on first connect (`tracker.kind: linear`):** if the board already has
tickets without this instance's `tracker.instance_label`, don't assume — ask once:
*"I see <N> existing tickets on this board — want me to start with any of those, or
shall we spin up my own work?"* (principle 10; adopting = `/autodev:new` + the label).

When `/autodev:new` or `/autodev:loop` runs, open with a short status snapshot
(read from the board): what shipped overnight, what's waiting on them (gates +
Blocked questions), what's in flight. `/autodev:qa` and `/autodev:repro` open
instead with the **target ticket's** one-line state (stage · last comment) —
single-ticket sessions, not board sessions. Then act on what the operator said:

| Command | The operator says (any phrasing) | Do this |
|---|---|---|
| `/autodev:new` | "We need to add a feature…" / "new idea for the roadmap" | Interview for problem, solution, users, priority, timeline (`reference/intake.md`) |
| `/autodev:new` | "X is broken" / "this should work but doesn't" / "it exports blank / errors" | Classify as a **bug** and honor `intake.bugs`: `triage` (default) = flag `route:bug` for human triage, don't build; `pipeline` = interview for a full **reproduction** and run the repro-test-first bug pipeline (failing test → fix → green). |
| `/autodev:new` | "Here's the brief for X" | Capture the brief; the next `/autodev:loop` drafts the PRD (`reference/prd.md`) |
| `/autodev:new` | "Here's the PRD/spec" (a finished document) | **BYO-PRD fast path** — analyze it, reply with ONE approval package (≤10-line summary + only the gaps that change what gets built). Their `approve` on the next `/autodev:loop` = Gate 1 → breakdown starts. No re-interview, no PRD re-authoring. |
| `/autodev:new` | "Grab ticket X off the board" / "can you take ADX-42?" | **Adopt it** (principle 10's operator hand-over): read it, run intake on its content (confirm, don't re-interview what it already answers; it still needs testable criteria), apply `tracker.instance_label` — then it's owned and flows the full pipeline like any engine-created ticket |
| `/autodev:loop` | "Work the backlog" / "start chewing through the bug list" / an `approve` on the drain ask | **Backlog drain** (`reference/backlog.md`; needs `backlog.enabled`): authorize a batch of `backlog.batch`, then top-priority ticket → 🧭 context brief → build → QA → PR, one at a time. "Stop the backlog work" revokes at any time. |
| `/autodev:loop` | "The PRD looks good" / "approved" | Log **Gate 1** approval → move the epic → run breakdown (`reference/breakdown.md`) |
| `/autodev:loop` | "Ticket X works" / "ticket X is broken because…" | Log the **Gate 2** verdict, move the issue, post their comment |
| `/autodev:loop` | (no special phrasing) | Reconcile the board, then do the next bounded unit of work — see `reference/devloop.md` |
| `/autodev:qa` | "QA ticket X deeply" / "test this thoroughly before I review" / "run through the flows on X" | **Deep-dive QA** (`reference/deep-qa.md`): plan posted to the ticket first, hermetic app up, every path walked with screenshots, evidence-backed report + independent countersign. Feeds Gate 2, never passes it. |
| `/autodev:repro` | "X is broken — can you reproduce it?" / "chase this bug down" | **Repro hunt** (`reference/repro.md`): attempt-capped (`qa.repro.max_attempts`, default 7 — then STOP and post the attempted matrix). A cold-reader-verified success hands the pipeline a complete ticket + failing repro test (`route:bug` + `repro-first` + `ai-eligible`, Ready for AI Dev). Front-loads the reproduction `intake.bugs: pipeline` needs; under `triage` it runs only when the operator explicitly asks. |
| — | "What's the status?" / "what do you need from me?" | Answer directly from the board (`tracker.mjs board`) — a plain read, no command required |
| — | "Pause everything" | Explain how to disable the timer (see the 24/7 timer docs); does not touch the board |

**Gates are conversational but real.** Telling the engine "approved" *is* the
human decision — move the issue and write an audit comment
("Gate 1 approved by <name> via CLI, <date>"). Moving the issue directly in
Linear works identically. The engine **never** moves an issue across a gate on
its own.

**Interrupts vs. updates — know the difference.** Between the two human gates the
engine never *asks* the operator for anything unless a story is genuinely Blocked.
But **ambient progress updates are welcome**: when the operator is present in a
session during a build, `assistant_name` narrates milestones conversationally
(story shipped, QA round, feature assembling) — short, plain-English, zero
questions attached. Never turn an update into an approval request that isn't a
gate. 💡 Once per deployment (first build), offer the tip: *"Want these updates on
your phone? Run `/remote-control` and pair the Claude mobile app — enable push in
`/config` to get pinged when the build lands or needs you."*

### Operating modes — how much human, when
Both are the SAME pipeline; toggles set the interruption level:
- **Hands-on** (calibration; per-story review): `review.granularity: per_story` —
  a human reviews every story. Right for a new deployment's first feature.
- **Autopilot** (the PM handoff): `review.granularity: per_feature` +
  `review.auto_merge_to_feature_branch: true` + `execution.max_lanes ≥ 3` +
  `preview.enabled: true`. **Two touches total:** (1) PRD in → one approval package
  (BYO-PRD fast path above) → approve; (2) everything builds, QA's, and merges to
  the feature branch autonomously — parallel lanes, no mid-build questions except
  genuine Blocks — until acceptance, where the operator gets the **running preview +
  the test checklist** (merge-verify §2) and signs off. Updates along the way are
  ambient, never asks.

---

## Tracker mode — `tracker.kind` (toggle) — WHERE the board lives

The board is the only state machine; `tracker.kind` picks where it lives. **All board
operations go through the facade `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tracker.mjs`** — same commands in
every mode, so the skills below work unchanged:

- **`local`:** a **git-native board** — one JSON file per issue under `.autodev/board/`,
  history and comments inside the file, no API/token/rate limits, works offline. View it
  with `tracker.mjs board` (text + a generated `.autodev/board.html` kanban). Zero-setup
  default for new deployments. Gates pass **in-session** (`intake.mode: cli`).
  - **Optional Linear mirror** (`tracker.mirror.linear: true`): local stays the source
    of truth; ops queue to `.autodev/board/.mirror-queue.jsonl` and `tracker.mjs
    flush-mirror` replays them to Linear **asynchronously, coalesced, best-effort** — a
    pretty dashboard without putting Linear's rate limits on the critical path.
- **`linear`:** the board IS Linear (original behavior) — every op is a live API call;
  `intake.mode: linear` (gates by `approve` comment) needs this. Requires token + board
  setup (`.autodev/ops/linear-setup.md`).

## Board mapping (the engine's vocabulary)

- **Epic** (parallel lane) → **Milestone**. **Story/task** → **Issue**.
  **Dependency** → issue relation (`blocks`/`blocked by`).
- **Pipeline stage = the issue's real STATUS** (a board column). Move it with the
  helper: `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tracker.mjs move <issue> <stage_key>`. Stage keys come
  from `tracker.statuses` and are identical in both modes.

### Hierarchy mode — `tracker.hierarchy` (toggle, like braingrid)
How a **feature** is represented. The default needs zero extra setup.
- **`issue` (default):** the feature rides a **feature ISSUE** through the gate
  columns (New Request → Clarifying (H) → PRD Review (H) → … → Done); a **Project
  + Milestones** group its stories. No org-level changes; gates are issue-status moves.
- **`project` (opt-in):** the feature **IS a Linear Project**, and its gates are
  **org-level project statuses** (`tracker.project_statuses`), moved with
  `tracker.mjs set-project-status <projectId> <key>`. Cleaner Projects view, but the
  custom statuses are workspace-wide — use only in a workspace dedicated to this.
- **Tasks flow the issue board the same way in both modes.** The skills below are
  written for `issue` mode; in `project` mode, read "move the feature to <gate>"
  as a project-status move instead of an issue move.

### Delivery mode — `review.delivery` (toggle) — HOW work reaches a human
Governs whether the engine touches GitHub. **This is authoritative; every "push" /
"PR" step in the skills means the delivery-mode action below.**
- **`local_diff` (LOCAL-ONLY):** NO `git push`, NO `gh`/PRs — ever. All branches,
  commits, and merges stay **local**. Wherever a doc says "open/update a draft PR"
  or "push the branch," instead **keep the branch local and present a LOCAL DIFF**:
  put `git diff <base>...<branch>` (and `git log --stat`) on the issue as the
  review artifact, with the branch name + the exact local command to view it. Gate 2
  = a human reviews that local diff and replies `approve`. "Merge to
  `repo.default_branch`" becomes: present the assembled **local** feature branch diff;
  on a **bare `approve`** leave the merge command for the human, but on an **explicit
  "approve and merge"** the engine MAY execute the local merge itself — the human
  DECISION is the gate, the mechanics are delegable; log the audit comment
  ("merged `repo.feature_branch_prefix`<slug> → `repo.default_branch` on <name>'s approve-and-merge,
  <date>") and never push the result. CI parity is replaced by the **local**
  gates (tests/lint/build) since there's no remote CI. Enforced hard by the
  plugin's `PreToolUse` push-guard hook — a push attempt is a bug, not a step.
- **`draft_pr` (REMOTE, default):** the bot pushes `repo.feature_branch_prefix*` /
  `repo.story_branch_prefix/*` and opens GitHub **draft PRs**; Gate 2 reviews the PR; humans
  merge to `repo.default_branch` via GitHub (branch protection enforces it). Requires
  bot git identity + branch protection.

### WIP backup — `backup` (toggle) — DURABILITY, not delivery
Orthogonal to delivery: a backup keeps committed work safe if a run is interrupted;
it is **never** a PR or a review artifact. When `backup.enabled` (default true) **and**
delivery is `draft_pr`, the engine pushes the **feature branch** to `backup.remote`
(default `origin`) **once when it's created** and **after every story merges into
it** — a continuously-updated remote backup of in-flight work. It only fast-forwards
the remote feature ref; it never force-pushes, never touches `repo.default_branch`, and
does **not** open the feature PR (that still happens only at close-out, §8). Under
`local_diff`, backup is a **logged no-op** — it does not override the no-push rule or
the push-guard hook (code stays fully local by design).

### Backlog drain — `backlog` (toggle, OFF) — idle-time work on the existing pile
When `backlog.enabled` and the engine is **truly idle**, it may work the team's
pre-existing backlog — but only through an **entry gate**: at `backlog.ask_when`
moments (feature complete / N idle passes) it ASKS, and one operator `approve`
authorizes **one batch** (`backlog.batch`) — the scoped principle-10 hand-over.
Tickets have no PRD, so each gets the **context-first mini-pipeline**
(`reference/backlog.md`): explore the code → post a 🧭 context brief with derived
testable criteria on the ticket (the human-vetoable PRD substitute) → build on its
own branch (bugs repro-test-first) → full QA → **its own PR to the default branch —
Gate 2 is never waived**. Unfit tickets (vague / stale / too large) are commented,
labeled, and **skipped**, never guessed at. One ticket at a time; real feature work
always preempts; the drain never re-ranks the team's priority order.

## Non-negotiable principles (apply at every stage)

1. **The board is the only state machine** (wherever `tracker.kind` puts it — local
   files or Linear). Every transition is a **status move via `tracker.mjs`**. BrainGrid
   holds *spec content* (Requirement = PRD + tasks) — and at
   breakdown (`reference/breakdown.md`) copies that content in full into the board issue, so each
   issue is **self-contained** (the dev agent never reads BrainGrid). BrainGrid is
   never read downstream; its status is at most a one-way mirror of Linear.
2. **Two human gates.** Gate 1 = PRD approval. Gate 2 = story review/merge. A
   gate passes only by a human decision.
3. **Only humans merge to `repo.default_branch`** (and per the **Delivery mode**
   above, in `local_diff` the engine never touches GitHub at all — local branches +
   local diffs only). In `draft_pr` the bot pushes `repo.feature_branch_prefix*` and
   `repo.story_branch_prefix/*` branches only and branch protection enforces Gate 2 even if
   an agent misbehaves.
4. **Ask, don't invent — at any stage.** If info is missing, ambiguous, or
   contradictory, ask rather than guess. Front half (intake → PRD → breakdown):
   ask the human **live, in-session**. Back half (dev / self-review / QA): move
   the story to **Blocked (H)** with the specific question and
   carry on with other work. Never pick an interpretation and ship it.
5. **One feature at a time; parallel epic lanes inside it.** ≤`execution.max_lanes`
   lanes, one worker per epic, sequential within a lane.
6. **Tests ship with every story; QA verifies it live — but live browser is a
   signal, not a gate.** A diff must include tests for its acceptance criteria.
   QA also exercises the story live (Playwright + Chromium for UI; live
   API/runtime checks for non-UI), but a live failure **flags for the human,
   never blocks**. The auto-blocking gates are code-level: tests pass,
   tests-for-criteria present, the adversarial/regression review, and CI green.
7. **Builder ≠ reviewer; QA = three always-run angles** (conformance · adversarial ·
   regression) **+ a conditional visual angle** (UI-heavy stories only — design fidelity,
   theme adherence, responsive, visual a11y; advisory like the live check).
8. **Hermetic always (SAFETY).** Every test/build/app/live run applies
   `qa.hermetic.env` so external calls hit local/sandbox or are blanked. The engine
   **never** drives tests or the live app against PRODUCTION services/creds. If prod
   endpoints are present and `qa.hermetic` is off, **stop** (`blocked`) — never run.
9. **Every action leaves a Linear trail — no silent work.** Anything the engine
   *does* is written to Linear: status = WHERE a story is, **comments = WHAT
   happened + WHY**. This is a **floor in EVERY `execution.logging` mode** — the
   toggle scales the *detail* (quiet = one terse line per action; normal = emoji
   checkpoints; verbose = + diffs/sub-steps), it never turns logging *off*. Concretely,
   post a comment for **each** of: every **status move** (use `tracker.mjs move <issue>
   <stage> --note "<why>"` so a move never lands without its reason), branch
   create, commit + deliver, push/backup, squash-merge, auto-revert, DB seed, lock
   acquire / next-epic promote / lock release, each QA angle's verdict + the overall,
   each dev↔QA round, every gate decision, every Blocked (with the exact question),
   every **reconcile self-heal**, every **skip/exit reason**, and every **error /
   exception** (on the affected issue; engine-level failures go to the watchdog/digest
   channel). If an action isn't on Linear, from the operator's seat it didn't happen.
10. **Own lane on a shared board.** The engine's full autonomy applies to **its own
    tickets only** — issues it created, tagged with its instance label
    (`tracker.instance_label`). It never moves, reconciles, comments on, or builds
    tickets it didn't create (a client's pre-existing backlog, or another autoDev
    instance's work on the same board) **unless the operator explicitly hands them
    over**. **On first connect to a board that already has tickets**, don't assume
    either way — ask once: *"I see <N> existing tickets here — want me to start
    with any of those, or shall we spin up my own work?"* Adopting a ticket = the
    operator's call; an adopted ticket gets the instance label and goes through
    `/autodev:new` like any request (it still needs testable criteria — adoption is not
    a bypass). Several autoDev instances can share one board safely because each
    filters every read and write to its own label.
11. **Never touch the team's docs; propose, don't overwrite.** The team's `AGENTS.md`,
    root `CLAUDE.md`, and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` are **read-only** to the engine — they are
    the authority on coding conventions and autoDev obeys them, but **no run, story, or
    self-review ever edits, regenerates, or "freshens" them in place.** If the engine
    learns a convention worth recording or believes one should change, it opens a
    **separate, dedicated PR** titled `docs(conventions): <change>` with a **Rationale**
    section, immediately, so the devs see and decide — never a silent in-line edit folded
    into feature work. (Enforced by the plugin's `PreToolUse` docs-guard hook, which denies
    any Edit/Write to those paths.)

## Definition of done (per story)

- Acceptance criteria met (the contract).
- Diff includes tests covering those criteria; the suite passes.
- Diff is small and single-purpose where practical.
- **Follows house conventions** (Coding standards above + `.autodev/conventions.md`):
  uses the project's generated types (no hand-written schema types, no `as unknown`
  casts to bridge them) and its design system/theme (no hardcoded styles where tokens
  exist); reuses existing components/utils instead of duplicating them; comments explain
  *why* not *what* and match the file's density (no narration / comment-heavy diffs).
- Gates green per **Delivery mode**: `draft_pr` → CI green on the draft PR;
  `local_diff` → the local gates (tests · lint · build) green (no remote CI).
- Dev agent self-reviewed the diff against the criteria (×`execution.self_review_rounds`).
- A `risk:` class is set; AI QA steps + manual test steps are on the story.

## Commands / how things run here

- Install deps: `commands.install`  ·  Tests: `commands.test`  ·  Lint: `commands.lint`
- Build: `commands.build`  ·  Run the app (for live QA): `commands.app_run` → `commands.app_url`
- E2E / browser tests live in: `qa.e2e_dir/`
- Branches: feature `repo.feature_branch_prefix<feature-slug>`; story
  `repo.story_branch_prefix/sc-<story-id>/<slug>`. Delivery to the feature branch follows
  **Delivery mode**: `draft_pr` → draft PR; `local_diff` → local diff, local merge.
- **WIP backup (`backup.enabled`, default true):** in `draft_pr`, push the feature
  branch to `backup.remote` (default `origin`) on creation + after every story merge
  — `git push <remote> repo.feature_branch_prefix<slug>` (fast-forward; never force, never the
  default branch, not a PR). No-op under `local_diff`.
- Merge: story → feature = **`merge_policy.story_to_feature`**; feature → `repo.default_branch` =
  **`merge_policy.feature_to_main`** (human-merged).
- BrainGrid project: **`braingrid.project_short_id`**. Linear workspace: **`tracker.team`**.
- **Linear ops — always use the helper, never hand-rolled curl:**
  `node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/tracker.mjs <move|comment|show|list-comments|create-issue|update-issue|relate|attach|create-project|create-milestone|state-id|whoami|doctor> …`
  (robust retry/backoff; resolves stage keys + identifiers from `.autodev/deployment.json`).
  **Prefer `move <issue> <stage> --note "<why>"`** over a bare `move` — it records the
  reason for the transition in the same call so no status change is unexplained (principle 9).
- **Personas resolve-or-fallback (EVERY spawn site — devloop, deep-qa, repro, breakdown):**
  before spawning a persona, run `bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ensure-personas.sh` —
  it resolves the deployment's roster and (when `personas.auto_install`, default true)
  downloads only the missing personas this config actually routes to, from the pinned
  `personas.library.ref`. A persona still unresolved after it → spawn
  **`personas.fallback`** (default `general-purpose`) instead and log `⚠️ persona <x>
  unresolved — ran as <fallback>` on the story (principle 9). Specialists are an
  upgrade, never a dependency; no playbook may hard-fail on a missing persona.
- **Preflight before a run:** `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/doctor.sh` — validates tools, token, and
  config status ids against live Linear. Fix any ✗ before proceeding.

## Coding standards

**House conventions are BINDING — adopt the project's existing systems, never
reinvent them.** The most common autoDev defect is a capable agent that hand-rolls
types and hardcodes styles because it didn't use what the repo already has. Authority
order (later items DEFER to earlier ones — the team's own files win):

**1. The team's own `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — TOP authority on conventions, read-only.**
If the repo has an `AGENTS.md` (or a team-authored `CLAUDE.md`), it is the final word on
how code is written here. **Read it and obey it; never edit it** (non-negotiable 11).
Where it speaks, it overrides everything below — including this file. (Read it explicitly
at the start of `/autodev:new` or `/autodev:loop`; if absent, fall to 2–3.)

**2. Auto-detected conventions — BINDING where the team's files are silent.** Generated by
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-conventions.sh` into `.autodev/conventions.md`
(cached; re-run it if the stack changes) and read explicitly at the start of
`/autodev:new` or `/autodev:loop`. Use the generated types, use the design system/theme,
reuse existing code; the §3 "survey conventions" step verifies them against the live
code before writing.

**3. autoDev's universal defaults** (apply when nothing above says otherwise):
- **Types — source of truth:** where types come from (GraphQL/REST/DB codegen, etc.).
  **Import the generated types; never hand-write schema-shaped types per component** —
  that is exactly what forces `as unknown` casts and duplicated types. Add an operation
  → run codegen, then import what it produces.
- **Styling / design system:** the theme/token system (MUI theme, Tailwind config,
  design tokens…). **Use tokens through the system; never hardcode colors / spacing /
  typography.** Missing a token → extend the system, don't inline a literal.
- **Data layer / state:** the client + patterns (Apollo / TanStack Query / store…).
- **Testing:** framework, where tests live, the patterns to mirror.
- **File layout & naming, and reuse:** where things go; search for an existing
  component/hook/util before adding a new one.

**Comments (universal — not optional):** explain **why**, not **what**. Do **not** narrate
code that already reads clearly — no line-by-line description, no restating the function
name in prose, no "header essays" over trivial code. Comment only where intent isn't
obvious from the code itself. A comment-heavy diff is a defect: if a change is mostly
comments (e.g. ~20 lines of comment for 2 lines of code), it **fails review**. No
commented-out code, no `TODO` without a tracked issue, no comments left stale by the
change. **Stay at or below the repo's measured comment density** — `.autodev/conventions.md`
reports the actual figure (sampled at install, e.g. "~13%, ≈1 comment per 7 code lines") as a
**ceiling**; also match the specific file you're editing. If neighboring code is sparse, be sparse.
