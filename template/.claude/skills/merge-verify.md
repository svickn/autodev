  Clean-room integration check after a merge. Reproduces CI/prod conditions
  (fresh checkout, clean install, full suite + build + e2e + live smoke) so
  "worked on my machine" can't slip through. Auto-reverts a bad merge and
  generates the report that backs the human's final prod sign-off.

# merge-verify — prove it works AFTER the merge, not just on the story branch

A story branch passing in isolation is NOT proof the *integrated* result works.
This is the engine's answer to classic "it worked on my local." Invoked by
`/devloop` after a squash-merge into the feature branch, and as the gate around
the human merge to `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}`.

## 1 · Clean-room integration check (after a merge into the feature branch)
- **Hermetic (B3 · SAFETY)** — export `qa.hermetic.env` first; the clean-room run
  (incl. the live smoke) must NEVER hit production services/creds.
- **Fresh state** — a clean checkout/worktree of the merged feature branch, NOT
  the dev's warm tree (`git clean -fdx` equivalent / separate worktree).
- **Clean install from the lockfile** — `{{CMD_INSTALL}}` (e.g. `npm ci`). Never
  reuse cached `node_modules`; this is what catches missing deps / lockfile drift.
- **Full gates on the integrated result** — run via the configured `qa.test_layers.*`
  (+ `qa.docker_up` / `qa.seed_test` prep) rather than a bare `{{CMD_TEST}}`, so the
  required exclusions/concurrency/seed are applied; plus `{{CMD_LINT}}` · `{{CMD_BUILD}}`
  · the e2e suite in `{{E2E_DIR}}/`. Judge against any `qa._known_baseline`.
- **Live smoke** — start the app (`{{CMD_APP_RUN}}` → `{{APP_URL}}`) and exercise
  the feature's critical path live (evidence-collector / Playwright); attach
  screenshots.
- **CI parity** — `draft_pr`: confirm CI green on the merge commit. `local_diff`:
  there is no remote CI — the local gates above ARE the parity check.

**Outcomes (log both — every action leaves a Linear trail, principle 9):**
- All green → 🗒️ comment `🧪 clean-room ✓ — fresh install + full gates + live smoke
  green on <feature branch>@<sha>` on the story/feature; continue.
- **Any failure** = an integration regression the isolated branch hid → **auto-revert
  that merge** (`git revert` the squash commit on the feature branch; `draft_pr` pushes
  the revert — 🗒️ log `↩️ reverted [sc-<id>] from <feature branch>` — `local_diff` keeps
  it local), then **`move <issue> ai_development --note "🧪 clean-room FAIL — <the
  integration regression>; reverted [sc-<id>], back to dev"`** (localize via the
  `[sc-<id>]` trailer), and re-enter the dev↔QA loop. **Never leave a broken shared
  branch — and never revert without logging it.**

## 2 · Feature acceptance QA + report (before the human gate)  ⟵ B1
When the feature is assembled and §1 is green, run a **whole-feature acceptance
pass** — this is the integrated check the per-story gates can't give you (it catches
cross-suite flakiness + verifies the system *as a whole*). Hermetic, on the
assembled branch:
- **Integrated suites** — run `qa.acceptance.integrated_suites` (the full
  cross-suite run on the whole branch, e.g. all backend + UI + e2e together), not
  just the per-story layers. Judge against `qa._known_baseline`.
- **Live system smoke** — if `qa.acceptance.live_system`, start the assembled app
  (`{{CMD_APP_RUN}}` → `{{APP_URL}}`) and drive an **end-to-end path across the
  whole feature** (multiple stories together, not one in isolation) via
  evidence-collector / Playwright; attach screenshots.
- A real failure here → localize to a story (`[sc-<id>]` trail), back to
  `ai_development`, re-QA — same as §1. Don't present a feature that fails integrated.

Then generate a **human-readable acceptance report** (post on the feature issue /
Project): stories shipped + QA verdicts · the **integrated-suite** result · the
**live-system** screenshots · CI status · anything flagged-not-blocked · the manual
test script.

**Preview environment (if `preview.enabled`) — the human accepts a RUNNING PRODUCT,
not a diff.** Start the assembled feature-branch app (`preview.command`, default
`{{CMD_APP_RUN}}`; **hermetic env applied** — a preview must never touch prod
services) and include in the acceptance comment: the **URL** (`preview.url`, default
`{{APP_URL}}`) and the **exact relaunch one-liner** (`git checkout
{{FEATURE_PREFIX}}<slug> && <command>` → URL). Ticks are stateless, so the engine's
instance may not outlive the session — the posted command is the durable path; the
running instance is a courtesy. 🗒️ `🖥️ preview up · <url> · relaunch: <cmd>`.

Then **`move <feature> ready_for_human_acceptance --note "🚦 Feature acceptance —
integrated suites ✓ · live smoke ✓ · report + preview posted; awaiting human
sign-off"`** (project mode: the equivalent `acceptance` project-status move).
**Stop — human decision.**

## 3 · Ship to `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` + sign-off (humans only) — per Delivery mode
- **`draft_pr`:** only a **human** merges the feature PR to `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` —
  branch protection enforces this; the bot never can. After it deploys, run a
  **post-deploy smoke** against the REAL environment (the deployed URL, not
  localhost), regenerate the report; **final prod sign-off is the human's**. If the
  post-deploy smoke fails, raise it immediately — **`move <feature> blocked --note "🛑
  post-deploy smoke FAILED on <real env> — <evidence>"`**.
- **`local_diff`:** nothing is pushed/deployed. The engine presents the assembled
  **local** feature-branch diff + the acceptance report; a human reviews and (if they
  choose) merges locally. There is no remote prod step — sign-off is on the local run.

## Guardrails
- Clean install (`npm ci`-equivalent, no warm cache) is non-negotiable — it's the
  whole point of this skill.
- A **revert** is always preferable to a broken shared branch.
- Per **Delivery mode**: `draft_pr` → the bot pushes `{{FEATURE_PREFIX}}*` /
  `{{STORY_PREFIX}}/*` and may squash story→feature, but NEVER merges into
  `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}` (needs bot git identity + branch protection). `local_diff` →
  the bot pushes **nothing** (enforced by `.git/hooks/pre-push`); it squashes
  story→feature **locally** and never merges `{{DEFAULT_BRANCH}}`.
