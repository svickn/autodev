# autoDev — first-install docs conflict scan. A pre-existing AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md is
# EXPECTED and good (autoDev defers to it for coding conventions). But if it also carries
# rules that fight the autoDev WORKFLOW — commit straight to main, skip tests, self-merge,
# "act autonomously without approval" — the engine and the repo pull against each other and
# the operator only finds out mid-run. This flags those up front so they're reconciled
# before a run. ADVISORY: heuristic, warnings only, never blocks (it always exits 0). The
# first Claude session also reconciles semantically (autodev.md concierge).

# Usage: check-docs.sh [repo_path]
