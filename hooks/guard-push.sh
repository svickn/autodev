# autoDev — push guard (PreToolUse hook). Blocks a Bash `git push` of the default
# branch, blanket push forms (--all/--mirror/--tags), ambiguous unqualified pushes
# (bare `git push` / `git push <remote>` with no ref, `git push ... HEAD`), and ALL
# pushes when review.delivery=local_diff — mirroring the old .git/hooks/pre-push
# guard without ever touching the repo's own git config. Reads
# .autodev/deployment.json from the tool call's cwd; fails open (allows) only when
# autoDev isn't configured in this repo at all (no .autodev/deployment.json) — a
# PRESENT but malformed config fails CLOSED (denies) instead, since silently
# allowing a push because the guard couldn't read its own rules would defeat the
# guard's purpose. Only guards pushes made through Claude Code — a human's own
# terminal is never affected (there is no hook installed outside this plugin).
